 <p>Earlier comprehensive mathematical methods were developed for
 study of periodicity of continuous and discrete numerical
 sequences, using Fourier transformation and allowing to define the
 spectral density of a numerical sequence. However, such application
 of Fourier transformation demands presentation of a symbolical
 sequence as a numerical sequence in which the properties of any
 symbolical text should be displayed unequivocally. The most widely
 used is the method, including construction from the given
 symbolical sequence of <b>m</b> sequences consisting of numbers
 zero and one, and formed according to the law: x(i,j)=1, if the
 symbol a<sub>i</sub> occupies a site j, and x(i,j)=0 in all other
 cases<b><i>.</i></b> Here <b>A</b>={a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>,
 &hellip;, a<sub>m</sub>} is the alphabet of a symbolical sequence
 and <b>m</b> is the size of the alphabet of a symbolical sequence.
 Then the Fourier transformation is applied to each of such
 numerical sequence and the Fourier-harmonics are calculated,
 corresponding to i-type symbols, as well as matrix structural
 factors, corresponding topair correlation of symbols.</p>
 <p>However, in our opinion the given method works rather well for
 study of periodicity of symbolical sequences with relatively short
 length (which is smaller than the size of the symbolical sequence
 alphabet). For the periods with the length greater than the size of
 the symbolical sequence alphabet, there is a possibility of
 "decomposition&rdquo; of the statistical importance of the longer
 periods in favor of the shorter ones. Thus it turns out that
 statistical importance of the longer period is a kind of "spread"
 onto the statistical importance of the shorter periods, i.e. there
 is an effect of attenuation of harmonics with longer periods in
 favor of harmonics with shorter periods. This effect will be even
 stronger for cases, where there are several replacements in
 periodic sequences, - in such sequences periods could not be simply
 identical.</p>
 <p>The main purpose of this work is to show our results for study
 of the DNA sequences by Information Decomposition (ID) method and
 to show the existence of the latent periodicity in lot of gene DNA
 sequences. Main principles of ID method were developed in early
 publications [1-4]. The ID method is similar to a Fourier
 transformation method for numerical sequences, but the first one
 has the following advantages: 1. The calculation of the ID spectrum
 does not require any transformation of a symbolical sequence to
 numerical sequences; 2. ID allows revealing both the obvious
 periodicity and the latent periodicity of a symbolical sequence in
 which there is no statistically important similarity between any
 two periods. 3. The statistical importance of long periods is not
 spread onto the statistical importance of shorter periods; 4. On
 the basis of the matrix M it is possible to determine the type of
 periodicity. In this work we present the results of study by ID
 method the DNA sequences from Genbank, version 122. This analysis
 permits to find more 1,5x10<sup>6</sup> DNA sequences with
 different types of latent periodicity with period from 6 to 200
 bases in Genbank. We found more than 5x10<sup>6</sup> sequences
 with different types of triplet periodicity also. For details see

 <p>The developed method of information decomposition (ID) of
 symbolical sequences proved to be capable to reveal latent
 structuredness of thousand of gene sequences. The results obtained
 with the method showed that a lot of known genetic texts contain
 sequences with latent periodicity of various lengths and various
 types, which could not be revealed earlier. The origin of latent
 periodicity in genetic texts might be connected both with evolution
 of genome and protein molecules, and with functional meaning of
 various sequences. For example, periodicity equal to 21 bases is
 usually connected with a-helix formation protein molecules. The
 longer periodicity could be determined by domain organization
 formation in proteins; it also could be involved in the process of
 nucleosome binding with DNA. We observed a great variety of period
 lengths and types in DNA sequences. It is possible to assume that
 ID method is able to "see" certain structural characteristics of
 gene sequences, reflecting the gene evolution or spatial
 organization of the corresponding proteins. In this regard ID is
 obviously important method allowing to connect the origin of
 certain protein structures with the presence of certain latent
 periodicity in corresponding DNA sequences.</p>

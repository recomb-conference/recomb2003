 <p><b>1</b> <b>Lattice Models</b></p>
 <p>Protein evolution proceeds through natural selection based on
 function. Function is determined by the three dimensional structure
 of the protein. Many proteins contain a binding pocket or active
 site, and this is an obvious focus for examining fitness. In order
 to consider molecular evolution on a broad scale, we need to
 consider vast evolutionary landscapes. To do this we employ a
 coarse-grained or lattice protein model using the shifted-HP
 folding code[1]. Residues are reduced to a single point on a
 lattice, and assigned as either hydrophobic or polar. This allows
 us to exhaustively search conformational space and sequence space,
 and find sequences that fold to a thermodynamically stable ground
 state. If a ground state structure has a binding pocket, it is said
 to be functional. We measure fitness by the number of hydrophobes
 in the binding pocket, an aspect relevant to non-specific
 hydrophobic binding.</p>

 protein. Dark residues are hydrophobic, light residues are polar. A
 ligand is shown to illustrate the position of the binding
 pocket.</p>
 <p>Previously [2] [3], we have considered functional model proteins
 on the two-dimensional square lattice. Here we consider the
 three-dimensional diamond lattice. An example of a functional model
 protein is shown in Figure 1.</p>
 <p><b>2</b> <b>Evolutionary Landscapes</b></p>
 <p>By an exhaustive search of sequence space, we are able to
 generate a fitness landscape, where we consider sequences connected
 by point mutations drawn as a graph (figure 2). We note several
 features of our landscapes. Each landscape is made up of one or
 more neutral networks, connected by adaptive mutations. A striking
 feature is the presence of &ldquo;hub&rdquo; sequences, which are
 able to make all these connections individually and which connect
 to the other hubs. These sequences, shown around the centre of
 figure 2, will allow rapid exploration of the different neutral
 networks.</p>
 <p>Another feature is the presence of evolutionary bottlenecks,
 where there is a restricted path from one area of the landscape to
 another. One significance of this could be in the prevention of
 drug resistance. If evolution to drug resistance proceeds through
 such a bottleneck, mutants along the path could be specifically
 targeted, reducing the likelihood that drug resistance would
 evolve.</p>

 mutation.</p>

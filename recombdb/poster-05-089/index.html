 <p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Introduction</b></p>
 <p>The primary point of contact between the nervous system and the
 olfactory environment occurs at the level of the olfactory
 receptor. A structural understanding of the interactions governing
 a receptor&rsquo;s selectivity for ligand would provide great
 insight into the process of olfactory perception. Olfactory
 receptors belong to the largest family of G-protein coupled
 receptors (GPCR). In the aquatic vertebrates, the particularity is
 that olfactory systems are tuned to detect water-soluble stimuli as
 amino acids. Molecular cloning has revealed that these odorant
 receptors belong to the G-coupled receptor family 3 which includes
 the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), the calcium sensing
 receptors (CaSR), the GABAb receptors, vomeronasal V2R receptors
 and some taste receptors (T1R) [1]. Members of this receptor family
 are characterized by their long N-terminal extracellular domain
 (NTD) where the ligand&nbsp; binding site is found. Extensive
 information on receptor structure and ligand-receptor interactions
 is available for the metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to
 that family [2,3]. However such data had not yet been described
 between amino acids and olfactory receptors. In the present study,
 we have generated a 3D-homology model of the NTD of&nbsp;
 OR5.24:&nbsp; a goldfish olfactory receptor which had been cloned
 and expressed, and for which complete ligand specificity has been
 assessed [4]. This receptor is preferentially tuned to respond to
 basic amino acids such as arginine or lysine, although the tuning
 is rather broad. Molecular docking&nbsp; of the 20 natural amino
 acids was performed . Models were validated through site directed
 mutagenesis. and functional analysis with calcium imaging. Results
 are discussed in term of structure-activity relationship and a
 correlation between binding affinities and scoring function is
 presented.</p>
 <p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Homology model and&nbsp; Agonist
 Docking</b></p>
 <p>The NTD of&nbsp; G-protein coupled receptor &nbsp;belonging to
 family 3 adopts a bilobate structure that closes upon ligand
 binding [1]. The closed conformation is recognized to be the active
 form of the receptor. A homology model of the OR 5.24 binding
 domain in its closed form was generated &ndash; using MODELER 6.00
 (Accelrys, San Diego) - on the basis of the mGluR1 crystal
 structure (PDB code 1ewk:A) [2] as described for other mGluR
 subtypes [3].</p>
 <p>We have previously shown that a common binding motif can be
 found in family 3 GPCR that bind amino acids as mGluRs, calcium
 sensing receptors (CaSR), taste receptors (T1R1, T1R3) and odorant
 receptor OR5.24 [3]. This motif is composed of five residues that
 bind the common glycine moiety of amino acids while selectivity is
 found around the side chain and the distal function (Fig.1). Thus,
 arginine, the most potent agonist, was bound to these residues in
 the OR5.24 NTD model. A molecular dynamics revealed several
 residues that bind selectively the distal guanidinium function. All
 putative binding residues were mutated and functional assays
 displayed a loss of potency between 5 to 1000 fold.</p>

 <p>Fig.1: Five residues constitute the common binding motif of all
 amino acid ligands of family 3 GPCR.</p>
 <p>The 19 other natural amino acids were then docked using a
 virtual screening technique: LigandFit (Cerius2, Accelrys, San
 Diego). For each ligand, a pose was selected according to its
 binding mode. Poses were subsequently scored using several scoring
 functions LIGSCORE, PLP, PMF, JAIN as implemented in Cerius2
 LigandFit. The best correlation between measured and predicted
 binding affinities [4] was obtained with the&nbsp; JAIN scoring
 fuction.</p>
 <p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Conclusion</b></p>
 <p>In the present study we have generated a structural model of the
 OR5.24 binding site and proposed a general model for recognition of
 amino acids. Proximal residues coordinate the common amino and
 carboxylic acid groups, while residues of the distal pocket ensure
 selectivity. This structural analysis offers an initial view into
 which receptor functionalities determine the ligand selectivities
 responsible for odorant discrimination and perception.</p>

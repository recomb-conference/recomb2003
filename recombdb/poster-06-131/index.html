 <p>The differentiation between cancerous and benign (non-cancerous)
 processes in the pancreas often poses a difficult diagnostic
 problem in the clinical setting while being of major importance for
 the treatment of patients. Since cancer development is caused by
 the accumulation of complex genetic alterations in the affected
 cells and tissues, the differentiation of cancerous vs.
 non-cancerous clinical samples is an important application
 &ndash;together with feature reduction methods&ndash; for the
 interpretation of DNA array data.</p>
 <p>Gene expression data have two dimensions, genes on one side, and
 measurements on the other side. While the expression level of
 several thousands of genes can be measured in a single experiment,
 only a few dozens of experiments are normally carried out, leading
 to datasets of very high dimensionality and low cardinality. In
 this situation, feature reduction techniques capable of reducing
 the dimensionality of data are essential for building predictive
 tools based on classification.</p>
 <p>In this study we used gene expression data collected at the
 University of Ulm from pancreatic cancer, healthy pancreas and
 chronic pancreatitis tissues using a DNA chip containing 486
 features preselected for their known or suspected involvement in
 cancerogenesis<sup>1,2,3</sup>. The 486 features were reduced to
 200. Nine features (genes) were removed from the analysis following
 visual inspection of the filter hybridization images because of
 overshining neighbouring signals. The remaining data set was
 filtered to include only genes for which normalized signal
 intensities were &gt;= 0.8 in at least 5 of 26 samples. The samples
 were separated into two groups, 15 from pancreatic cancer tissue
 and eleven form healthy pancreas or chronic pancreatitis
 tissues.</p>

      ">The feature reduction step was performed by performing a
      principal component analysis. Figure 1 shows the eigenvalues
      of the covariance matrix sorted in decreasing order. Based on
      these results the first ten principal components were chosen
      for the subsequent analysis. Figure 2 shows the projection of
      the 26 samples onto the first two principal components.</p>
 <br clear="all">
  
 <p>Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves show the
 sensitivity (true-positive rate) against the 1-specificity
 (false-positive rate), they are used to assess the diagnostic value
 of tests depending on a single cut-off value of a continuous
 variable. The most commonly used quantitative global index
 summarizing the information provided by this curve is the area
 under it. A large area indicates a good discriminative ability of
 the marker with a single cut-off value. Su and Liu<sup>4</sup> have
 shown that Fisher's linear discriminant maximizes sensitivity
 uniformly over the entire range of specificity when the two
 distributions are assumed normal with proportional covariance
 matrices. This linear combination also generates a new virtual
 diagnostic marker and can be regarded as a perceptron training
 procedure in two phases (a) determining the direction of the
 hyperplane and (b) setting the threshold. We used ROC curves to
 assess the diagnostic ability of all linear combinations (1023) of
 the first ten principal components (pc) and ranked the resulting
 virtual markers in terms of their area under the ROC curve. Figure
 3 shows the best singular pc, and Figure 4 the best linear
 combination with the least number of features (pc 1, 2, and 4).
 Compared to the already remarkable 92% accuracy on the first pc
 (see Figure 2 and 3), the 96% accuracy on the linear combination of
 three principal components (Figure 4) seem even more promising.</p>

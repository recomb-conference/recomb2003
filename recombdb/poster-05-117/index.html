 <h2>117.&nbsp; Consensus approach for benchmarking domain
 assignment in protein structures</h2>
 <p align="center"><b>Stella Veretnik, Nickolai Alexandrov, Phil
 Bourne, and Ilya Shindyalov</b></p>
 <p><b>Keywords:</b> protein structure, domain assignment, algorithm
 benchmarking</p>
 <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
 <p>Assignment of domains in protein structures remains to be a
 difficult and unsolved problem. Existing algorithms frequently
 produce contradicting results, different from expert&rsquo;s
 assignment.&nbsp; In this work we examine trends in the performance
 of a new generation of completely automated domain assignment
 algorithms. We have benchmarked the following automatic methods:
 DALI [3], DomainParser [4], and PDP [5] using the dataset of
 proteins with domains assigned by experts [6] and using the
 consensus subset of these proteins in which the domain definition
 agrees with two other expert-based assignments by SCOP [1] and CATH
 [2]..</p>
 <p><b>Methods and Results</b></p>
 <p>The benchmark was created from 2363 protein chains cut into
 domains by authors of the crystal structures [6].&nbsp; The set was
 cleaned by purging chains that have more than 90% sequence
 identity, resulting in a set of 749 structures which was further
 reduced to 599 chains present in all manually curated databases
 (SCOP, CATH, and author&rsquo;s assignments).&nbsp; Using this
 benchmark we assessed the correctness of the number of domains
 assigned by each method as well as the consistency in the domain
 boundaries definition.</p>
 <p>We first compared consistency of prediction of automatic and
 manual assignments.&nbsp; We defined disagreement value as
 (variance of the number of domains&nbsp; +1).&nbsp; Disagreement
 values for each chain were calculated separately for automatic
 methods (DALI, DomainParser, PDP) and for manual methods (CATH,
 SCOP, author&rsquo;s assignment).&nbsp; We then looked at the ratio
 of disagreement value produced by automatic methods and the
 disagreement value produced by manual methods (for each
 chain).&nbsp; We find that in 80% of the chains this ratio is 1,
 indicating that the domain assignment disagreement of automatic and
 manual methods is identical.&nbsp; The remaining 20% of the chains
 are nearly evenly split between the cases in which manual
 disagreement is higher that automatic disagreement and visa
 versa.&nbsp; We interpret this as an indication that for some
 proteins, consensus on domain assignment is as difficult to reach
 for human experts as for algorithms.<a id="_anchor_1"

 <p>Compared to the author&rsquo;s assignment, most of the methods
 tend to under-cut (i.e. to assign too few domains), this tendency
 is particularly evident in SCOP (Figure 1).&nbsp; The exception to
 this is automatic assignment method DALI, which produces equal
 fraction of over-cuts and undercuts.&nbsp; For all methods the
 correct assignment rate is between 80 and 90%, with lowest for DALI
 (automatic assignment) and highest for CATH (manual
 assignment).</p>

 </p>
 <p>Domain assignment can be done differently even by experts. To
 avoid ambiguity in domain definition we have eliminated problematic
 cases from the benchmark and focused on the 84% of the chains
 (total of 502 chains), in which manual assignment methods reached
 the consensus.&nbsp; When chains without manual consensus were
 removed, all automatic methods showed a rather dramatic drop in the
 fraction of incorrectly predicted under-cut assignments; while the
 effect on incorrectly predicted over-cuts was rather modest&nbsp;
 (Figure 2).</p>

 <p>Automatic assignments were grouped by the number of chains which
 disagree with manual consensus.&nbsp; We find that all automatic
 methods tested agreed with manual consensus for 443 chains; this
 represent 88% of all chains for which manual consensus was
 reached.&nbsp; In the remaining cases (59 chains) one or more
 automatic method disagreed with manually assigned consensus.&nbsp;
 We are studying these cases in further detail in an attempt to
 understand the underlying assumptions that lead to erroneous
 automatic assignments.&nbsp; Some interesting cases are those in
 which automatic methods produced 3 different assignments (in 3
 cases, one example in Figure 3).&nbsp;&nbsp; Other interesting
 cases are those where all automatic methods failed to cut a chain,
 which is predicted by manual consensus to have 2 or 3 domains (3
 such cases).&nbsp; For all three cases failure to cut is associated
 with short DNA-binding proteins.</p>

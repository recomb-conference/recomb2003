 <p><b>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Introduction</b></p>
 <p>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent
 variations in the human genome, and have attracted much interest in
 a wide range of biological and biomedical applications. Recent
 researches are focused on identifying disease susceptibility genes
 and finding associations between these markers and disease
 phenotypes using SNPs. For complex diseases, genome-wide scanning
 in association studies has been suggested, which is carried out by
 testing for differences in SNP allele frequencies between affected
 and unaffected individuals (case-control studies). Because complex
 diseases arise from multiple genes throughout the genome and
 contribution of each gene is small, many assays must be carried out
 to detect whole genotypes in a large sample size of individuals
 with tens of thousand SNPs. Due to the rapid advances of
 high-throughput, integrated technologies in genotyping of SNPs,
 bottlenecks have been shifted from the wet lab experiments to large
 data analyses and management generated by the experiments.
 Therefore it may be necessary to develop a robust, integrated and
 automated system for analyzing vast genotyping data to catch up
 with high-throughput genotyping system. We propose an integrated
 analysis system which is specialized for genome-wide scanning with
 large number of SNPs in case-control studies.</p>
 <p><b>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Materials and
 Methods</b></p>
 <p><b>Experiments</b></p>
 <p>We have conducted several case-control studies of complex
 diseases with Korean population. Our genotyping platform is
 MassARRAY<sup>TM</sup> (Sequenom, Inc.), which can detect mass
 differences of the products generated from primer extension by a
 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
 (MALDI-TOF). It is semi-automated system and has its own
 ORACLE<i>8i</i> databases for data deposition and visualization
 software.</p>
 <p><b>Programming language and platform</b></p>
 <p>The analysis system was written in Perl and Oracle PL/SQL. All
 databases were built on ORACLE<i>8i</i>. It runs on WindowsNT
 server.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><b>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Results and Future
 Works.</b></p>
 <p><b>SNP analysis system: Analysis pipeline</b></p>
 <p>We have been developing the prototype of the SNP analysis system
 based on the following pipeline (Fig. 1). The system is primarily
 focused on the integration of all information which is related to
 the samples, clinical information of each individual for different
 diseases, assays, sequences, SNP information, and experiment
 results. Furthermore we have developed sql scripts and SAS macro
 programs for further statistical analyses of case-control studies
 and quality control of genotyping results.</p>
 <p>In the future, we are going to finish the integration of this
 system, and build a data warehouse. Also we will develop user
 interfaces, report generators, and visualization tools for mapping
 SNPs and analysis results, which are easy, simple and intuitive for
 the end users. In addition, an algorithm appropriate for
 genome-wide scanning approach in case-control studies will be
 developed to select minimal set of informative SNPs for the
 application to the molecular diagnosis of complex
 diseases.&nbsp;</p>

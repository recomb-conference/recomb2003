 <h4>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</h4>
 <p>In recent studies gene expression profiling of non-hereditary
 breast cancer has been increasingly popular. One way of sample
 differentiation of predominant clinical relevance usually assessed
 in those articles in the presence or absence of the Estrogen
 receptor in the tumor samples. At present, though, there is no
 consensus whether cDNA- or Oligo-microarrays handle expression
 profiling better. We have started to assess the comparability of
 five published data sets generated by different array
 technologies.</p>
 <h1>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material and
 Methods</h1>
 <p>We compared five published data sets of microarray studies
 ([1]-[5]), in total expression data of 319 tumor samples. For all
 samples the immune histochemical status of the Estrogen Receptor
 had been identified in the laboratory and published either within
 the articles or as supplement to them. The five data sets were
 generated using different microarrays and microarray-technologies.
 We use only the published raw data and disregard the statistical
 analysis performed by the experimentators. To compare the data, two
 major steps are required:</p>
 <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 First we had to find the portion of genes whose expression values
 were measured within all five studies. Since the annotation of the
 Oligos/cDNA spotted on microarrays varies widely, we related the
 annotation information of each data set (for instance CloneID or
 Genbank accession) to their related Homo sapiens Unigene-Cluster ID
 (Unigene-Buid 153) to obtain one common annotation for all 319
 samples. By choosing the Unigene-Cluster-ID we avoid redundancies
 and disregard the expression values of Oligos/cDNA that cannot be
 related to any known human gene or are only spotted for experiment
 control. Having the Oligos/cDNA spotted on all microarrays
 annotated the same way we could determine an intersection of 1055
 genes presumably measured on all used microarrays. These 1055 genes
 include well-known genes for differentiating
 Estrogen-Receptor-positive versus -negative tumor samples such as
 the gene of the receptor itself and the gene of the GATA binding
 protein 3.</p>
 <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Second we needed to transform the numerical values of the data sets
 to render them comparable to each other. Therefore we declared the
 data set of Gruvberger et al. [2] our reference data set and
 adjusted the numerical values of the other four data sets to the
 numerical range of this refer&shy;ence data set. The reason why we
 chose this particular data set for reference is that it has the
 largest number of samples with no missing expression values for any
 of our 1055 genes. Although there are larger data sets in our
 analysis [3, 5], we deemed them inappropriate as refer&shy;ence
 data set because for some of the samples therein and some of the
 1055 genes they lack expression values.</p>
 <p>We adjusted the numerical values using median rank scores. For
 each of the 1055 genes we cal&shy;culated the median expression
 over the 58 samples of Gruvberger's data set and ordered the
 results from lowest to highest, thus obtaining a reference ranking.
 Gruvberger et al. used a two-colour cDNA-microarray so their
 expression values are the logarithms of tumor- versus
 control-intensity ratios. Therefore the 1055 values of the
 reference ranking range from negative to positive numbers with the
 middle ranks close to zero.</p>
 <p>For each individual sample of the other four data sets we
 extracted the expression values for the 1055 genes, replacing
 missing values with zero, meaning no expression of this gene above
 or below the norm in the particular sample, and ordered these
 values also from lowest to highest. We then replaced these 1055
 expression values with the expression values of our reference
 ranking according to their rank. Thus all 319 samples have
 expression values in the numerical range of our reference data
 set.</p>
 <p>We use the R-package PAM (prediction analysis of microarrays) of
 Tibshirani et al.[6] for evaluation of the data. Our focus is
 classification of the samples into Estrogen-receptor positive
 versus -negative. The class prediction of PAM is based on a
 modified nearest-centroid classification. It uses a set of training
 samples of known class to compute a centroid for each class,
 shrinking these class centroids towards the overall centroid to
 reduce overfitting. Thus genes having a mean within-class
 expression close to their mean expression over all samples, do not
 contribute to this class-centroid. The optimal amount of shrinkage
 is determined by cross-validation. Samples of unknown class are
 then classified according to their squared distance from each of
 the shrunken class centroids [6].</p>
 <p>In the beginning we examined the applicability of PAM to the
 classification of Estrogen-receptor status (ER-status) by testing
 and training on the samples of the same data set. In a first run we
 allowed all 1055 genes for centroid calculation, in a second run
 the gene of the Estrogen receptor (Hs.1657) was excluded from the
 data only for the purpose of centroid calculation.</p>
 <p>To assess the influence of the used microarray technology we
 have trained PAM on one data set and predicted the
 Estrogen-receptor status of the samples from the other four data
 sets.</p>
 <p>Third we have repeatedly used PAM on all 319 samples randomly
 assigning one half of the samples to training-set and predicting
 the ER status of the other half to find genes which strongly
 predict the ER-status regardless of used microarray technology.</p>
 <h4>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preliminary
 results</h4>
 <p>Within each of the 5 data sets the differentiation into
 ER-positive versus -negative proved to be possible with few errors
 even when the gene of the receptor itself was excluded.</p>
 <p>Shrunken class centroids built on one data set can be used to
 predict the ER-status of the samples of other data sets with a
 medium accuracy of 77%. This prediction accuracy, though, shows a
 large variance and is noticeably worse when the gene of the
 estrogen receptor is excluded from the training procedure. Certain
 inter-data set properties such as difference in size and
 similarities in the used microarray technologies seem to affect the
 prediction accuracy discernibly.</p>
 <p>Training and testing on data sets randomly drawn from all 319
 samples has lead to 80-85% correct predictions. Next to the known
 marker genes of the Estrogen receptor and the GATA binding protein
 3 some other genes seem to have a remarkable influence on
 classification of the ER-status, for instance the
 Ornithin-Decarboxylase 1 (Hs.75212), the CDC20-cell-cycle regulator
 (Hs.82906) or the transcription-factor Forkheadbox M1 (Hs.239).</p>

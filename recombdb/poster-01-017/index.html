 <p><b>Keywords:</b> genome browser, annotation, extensible software
 tool,</p>
 <p><b>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Introduction</b></p>
 <p>With the advances of human genome project and other sequencing
 projects, large volume of se&shy;quence data has been
 generated.&nbsp; Recent progress of proteomics will generate even
 larger amount of data. To extract biological signals from these
 data will require a new generation of software tools, such as
 genome browser or other data mining programs. A genome browser
 allows a researcher to view genomic data at a level higher than
 pure nucleic acids, for example, at level of genes, pathway, or
 gene families, and is a valuable tool in genomic research.</p>
 <p>Currently, there are already some good genome browsers available
 for visualization of genomic data. UCSC human genome browser
 displayed different annotation data, such as EST, gene
 pre&shy;diction, SNP, etc, on each aligned track [1]. New
 annotations can also be added as a new track in the display.
 Ensemble is a web-based visualization tool that provides a
 framework for displaying known and unknown genes, OMIN disease
 annotation, protein family and gene family [2]. NCBI&rsquo;s map
 viewer can display contigs, genes, STS markers, and reference links
 to other resources [3].&nbsp; Although such browsers are very
 useful tools for displaying the information that most users need,
 some users may require different kinds of information to be shown.
 Also, most of the information displayed are mostly pre-computed and
 static, even though they are updated very quickly, some users may
 need real-time data.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In this paper, we will describe the design and implementation of
 a simple genome browser that allows a user to choose the datasets
 to display, to select the information to display, and is extensible
 that new features can be added as plug-in functions whose execution
 results may be displayed as well.</p>
 <p><b>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Results and
 Discussion</b></p>
 <p>In Figure 1, a display of our genome browser is shown, where
 some gene related information are contained in different panels.
 The organism is shown at the left corner. A user can click and
 select the desired chromosome from the upper right panel. At the
 upper left, the number of genes in each region is shown, where each
 region consists of 2,500,000 nucleic acids. A user may move to the
 desired region using the scroll-bar below. The size of the regions
 may also be adjusted by zooming in or zooming out. At the central
 part, the identity and location of each putative gene in the
 selected region are shown. This panel is also scrollable.
 Currently, the genes shown are either confirmed refGenes or
 predicted by GenScan [4]. But more data sources can be added as
 well. The exons and other detailed information about a gene are
 shown at the lower left panel.</p>
 <p>The lower right part is a novel feature of our browser where a
 user can trigger BLAST or other programs to search the selected
 database. For example, a user may use BLAST to search the whole
 human genome for genes in the same family, or to search a protein
 database for homologous protein sequences. Although only BLAST is
 shown, a user may selected another search program, add more
 databases, or add other programs for different processing.</p>

 <p>The system is currently implemented as a stand-alone program,
 but will be changed to a web-based tool in the future. The system
 is consisted of about 6000 Java statements and was completed by
 single a person within four months. The database system we used is
 MySQL, which is widely available, but any database that supports
 JDBC can be used as well. Our genomic datasets and annotations are
 from UCSC Genome Bioinformatics. The genome sequences are Human
 05Apr2001, mmFeb2002, and rnNov2002, and the annotations are
 RefGene and GenScan.</p>

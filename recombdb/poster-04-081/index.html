 <h2>81. Alu Evolution and Mutation Pressure</h2>

 Isochores, Mutation Pressure, Genetic Distances</p>
 <p><b>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Introduction</b></p>
 <p>Since the finding that the Alu repetitive element family is much
 more abundant in GC-rich isochores (maximum in H2) than in AT-rich
 ones, an ongoing discussion exists on which mechanism leads to this
 biased distribution ([2], [4], [5]). It is known ([4]) that Alus
 prefer to insert in GC-poor genomic regions and therefore the
 question rises which mechanism shifts the density maximum from
 GC-poor to GC-rich regions. An extended opinion is that the Alus
 shift towards GC-rich regions to lessen the mutation pressure upon
 them (see [1], [4]). Alus are GC-rich and by installing in GC-rich
 isochores it is thought that the increased compositional match
 increases likewise their stability in the GC-rich parts of the
 genome.</p>
 <p>However, taking into consideration all Alus irrespective of
 their age, it can hardly be determined if this mechanism is the
 most important or just plays a minor role. To trace the evolution
 of the Alus in the human genome, we determined their densities and
 GC-contents as a function of their age. We first align each Alu in
 the genome to its family consensus using the RepeatMasker
 algorithm. The Tamura-Nei distance was then used to estimate the
 Alu ages. The partition of the contigs into isochores was performed
 using the IsoFinder segmentation algorithm of Oliver, et al (see
 [3] and references therein).</p>
 <p><b>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Compositional adjustment of
 repeats to the isochores</b></p>
 <p>By analysing the Alus as a function of their age, it is possible
 to monitor the changes suffered by the Alus over time. In Figure 1
 we show a) the relative density ratios H*/L (densities in the H
 isochores divided by the densities in the L isochores) as a
 function of their age and b) the course of the Alu GC-contents in
 the different isochores also as a function of their age. It can be
 seen (graph b) that up to genetic distances of around 0.08 no
 correlation between the GC of the isochore and the element becomes
 established. Just from these genetic distances on, the elements
 seem to note the influence of the isochore. However, as can be
 inferred from graph a, at these genetic distances the maximum has
 already shifted to the H2 isochores. This means that long before
 the elements seem to note the compositional pressure of the
 isochore, the density maximum has changed. By calculating the
 GC-content without the CpG dinucleotides (not shown here), it can
 be observed that the change in GC suffered by young elements is
 predominantly due to mutations of the CpGs, which do not seem to
 depend on the isochore. The %GC without the CpGs hardly vary with
 the Alu age and the change stays within 1%. If mutation pressure
 was the main mechanism, one might expect a greater influence of the
 isochore on the element&rsquo;s base composition.</p>
 <p>As a second quantitative measurement of mutation pressure
 strength we have calculated the number of deletions and insertions
 suffered by the elements, which is only possible using aligned
 sequences. Although the results confirm the general validity of the
 mutation pressure theory (more GC insertions in GC-rich than in
 AT-rich parts and more AT insertions in AT-rich than in GC-rich
 regions), we found again that the differences of this mutation
 pattern between the different isochores is just weakly pronounced.
 We found that just one out of ten elements show one G or C
 additionally inserted in H3 compared with the L isochores. The AT
 insertion mechanism acts slightly stronger but also just one out of
 five repeats has one A or T additionally inserted in an L isochore
 compared with H3.</p>

 <p><a name="_Ref26901070">Figure 1</a>: Density ratios between H
 and L isochores (a).&nbsp; It can be seen that the densities shift
 very fast from the L isochores towards the H isochores. The
 GC-content of the Alus in the different isochores are depicted in
 (b). The GC-content do not show a dependence of the isochores below
 genetic distances of around 0.08.</p>
 <p><b>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Summary</b></p>
 <p>An analysis of the Alus as a function of their age is presented.
 The main change in GC is caused by CpG mutations, which do not
 depend on the isochore. A correlation between the GC-content of the
 isochores and the elements is not established until genetic
 distances of around 0.08. As the density shift takes place yet
 around genetic distances of 0.03 we infer that, although mutation
 pressure has definitely an influence on the base composition it may
 not be sufficient to explain the density shift and the biased
 distribution of the Alus in the human genome. The weak influence of
 mutation pressure on the distribution of the Alu elements is also
 confirmed by the analysis of AT and GC insertions.</p>

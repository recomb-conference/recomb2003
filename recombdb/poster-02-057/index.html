 <p><b>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Introduction</b></p>
 <p>Due to newly developed high-throughput technologies for
 DNA-sequencing, the number of fully sequenced species increase
 significantly. The statistics show that the size of databases
 holding these sequences, like GenBank, has doubled every 15 months.
 Index structures for very large string databases are needed.</p>
 <p>Suffix trees have been established as a data structure allowing
 many different kinds of search operations needed in this
 application field ([2], [3]). They belong to the wider class of
 suffix structures which are the most suitable data structures on
 top of a text which can't broken in words. This situation also
 appears in video databases or in large texts used for
 spell-checking. The complexity of an exact search for a substring
 in a suffix tree depends only on the length of this string, and is
 independent of the length of the coded text unlike to suffix
 arrays.</p>
 <p>There is a large literature about transient suffix trees. But
 even with the most space efficient implementation using 13 bytes
 per indexed letter, a transient suffix tree for very large strings
 cannot be created in-memory and cannot be held there. Therefore,
 the construction of a persistent suffix tree is needed as well as
 storing on disk in an efficient way.</p>
 <p>A partitioning algorithm has been introduced in [1], where a
 large tree is divided in partitions, each of them created in-memory
 and then written on disk. Hereby PJama is used which makes the
 in-memory structure automatically persistent. In [1] it has been
 mentioned that a space efficient implementation is needed.</p>
 <p>In [4] this partitioning algorithm has been improved by
 introducing variable length of the prefixes determining the
 partitions and therewith preventing the failure of the algorithm in
 [1]. This approach is adapted to the blocksize of the disk and
 avoids the creation of many low occupied partitions. Among other
 things these small partitions support the big size of the index on
 the disk.</p>
 <p>This poster addresses the question in which way one can store
 the tree on disk and makes fast access possible. I introduce a
 coding scheme which optimizes disk saving and therefore preventing
 unneeded disk access.</p>
 <p><b>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>My Approach</b></p>
 <p>A suffix tree is a compressed digital trie, which only stores
 two references to all sistrings of the text in a trie. Here a
 sistring is a substring of text which is defined by its starting
 position and continues to the right as far as necessary to make the
 string unique. In order to find the proper child node during a
 search one has to jump to the DNA file, seek the position and match
 the characters. Usually the DNA letters are not coded on the edges
 of the tree. This causes a bottleneck which lies in the random
 access to the text being indexed. To avoid this its useful to code
 the sistrings in the index itself. Algorithms, which traverse
 repeatedly the tree from bottom to up and reverse, profit from this
 advantage. Therefore the tree I introduced is more a compacted
 suffix trie ending with leaves&nbsp; making the suffixes unique.
 Theoretically the transition from a trie to a tree reduces the
 storage requirements from O(n&sup2;) to O(n). I show that the small
 size alphabet of DNA enables an efficient coding of both, the tree
 topology, and the letters of the DNA. In this way there is no
 considerably loss of storage space.</p>
 <p>For coding the local tree topology one can use a lookup table.
 Due to the small alphabet size 4, every node of the tree can have
 at most 4 child nodes leading to a branching configuration of the
 tree in following manner:</p>

 <p>In this way, only maximal 4 bits for each branching node are
 necessary in order to cipher the branching node as well as the
 branching letter. Nodes with only one child are compressed and only
 2 bits are needed for the encoding of each letter of the sistring.
 Now, one can store the local tree topology linearly in an
 array.</p>
 <p>In my application, it is necessary to be able to traverse the
 tree selectively, i.e. to extract a subtree of the suffix tree.
 Since the nodes are arranged in one large array, one has to know
 the&nbsp; number of nodes which are skipped in order to find the
 right branching node. To solve this problem I use additional
 storage for relative branch pointers (skipp pointers). For each
 node in the tree this pointer is exactly&nbsp; the number of bytes
 in the subtree below. Thus the expensive storage of absolute
 pointers is avoided, which would usually require more memory than
 the data itself. But also some of the relative pointers can get
 quite large, therefore it's useful to allocate variable sized
 memory for the pointers. My experiments show that this can reduce
 the storage requirement significantly.&nbsp; In this way, the
 average storage requirement for a branch pointer is less than 3
 bytes independently of the depth of the suffix tree.</p>
 <p>I introduce different node modes taking into account the various
 structure of different node types. Since each node has at most 4
 subtrees it leads to the following data type:</p>
 <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="493">

 <p align="center">Skipp Pointer</p>
 <p align="center">variable sized</p></td></tr></table>

 structure.</p>
 <p>These scheme allows a very fast and efficient tree traversal,
 since only a few bit operations are necessary to find subsequent
 letters.</p>

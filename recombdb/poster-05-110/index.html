 <h2>110.&nbsp; Hierarchical Clustering of Protein Structures by
 using information of Multiple Structural Alignments</h2>

 <p><b>Keywords:</b> Structure, Alignment, Protein, Superposition,
 Fold, Sub-structure, Clustering</p>
 <p><b>1 Introduction</b></p>
 <p>Multiple structural alignments methods have been used for
 detailed structural and functional analysis of protein families, in
 order to determine conserved residues useful in comparative
 modeling of related proteins and to propose hypothesis about their
 origins and evolutionary history.</p>
 <p>Recently, we have developed a new multiple protein structural
 alignment method (MALECON) that maximizes the number of spatially
 equivalent residues [1]. Our approach uses as starting point a set
 of pair wise structural alignments and produces several multiple
 structural alignments, which are most consistent with this set, and
 where the proteins are optimally superimposed. This set of
 alternative solutions can facilitate the detailed study of both,
 the conserved residues and the structural variations in a protein
 family. The algorithm is not forced to always produce at least one
 multiple structural alignment for the entire set of proteins. If
 the global consistency is below the level specified by the user,
 multiple alignments are produced only for subsets of the
 proteins.</p>
 <p>In this works we show how the ability of MALECON to produce many
 alternative solutions for multiple alignments of protein structures
 can be used to perform a clustering analysis of protein structures
 with the same architecture but with different topology. The
 clustering results obtained by using information from multiple
 structural alignments are compared with those obtained by a more
 standard approach based on pair wise structural similarities.</p>
 <p><b>2 Methods</b></p>
 <p><b>Clustering protein structures using information from multiple
 structural alignments.</b></p>
 <p>Given a set of protein structures
 p<sub>1</sub>,..,p<sub>n</sub>, and a set S = {
 S<sub>k</sub><sup>l</sup> : 1 &le; <i>k</i> &le; <i>m,</i> 3 &le;
 <i>l</i> &le; <i>n</i> } of <i>m</i> optimal solutions of multiple
 protein alignments obtained by using MALECON, where
 S<sub>k</sub><sup>l</sup>, the kth solution in which <i>l</i>
 proteins are optimally superimposed and if
 v<sub>k</sub><sup>l</sup>=(x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,..,x<sub>n</sub>)
 is a binary vector corresponding to S<sub>k</sub><sup>l</sup>,
 where x<sub>i</sub> &nbsp;takes value 1 when protein p<sub>i</sub>
 is present in the solution S<sub>k</sub><sup>l</sup> and 0 in the
 other case, the distance
 <i>d<sub>J</sub>(p<sub>i</sub>,p<sub>j</sub>)</i> between any two
 protein structures p<sub>i</sub> and p<sub>j</sub>, according to
 the Jaccard Coefficient can be calculated as follow:</p>
 <p><sub><img width="93" height="29" src="image003.gif"></sub>,</p>
 <p>where r, s and q are the total number of solutions in which
 x<sub>i</sub>=1 and x<sub>j</sub>=0,&nbsp; x<sub>i</sub>=0 and
 x<sub>j</sub>=1 ,&nbsp; x<sub>i</sub>=1 and x<sub>j</sub>=1,
 respectively.</p>
 <p>The distance matrix was generated by applying
 <i>d<sub>J</sub></i> to all pair of proteins. The clustering
 procedure was done by using the neighbor joining method as
 implemented in the PHYLIP [2] package.</p>
 <p><b>Clustering protein structures using information on pair wise
 structural alignments.</b></p>
 <p>Given a set of protein structures
 p<sub>1</sub>,..,p<sub>n</sub>, the distance
 <i>d(p<sub>i</sub>,p<sub>j</sub>)</i> was calculated as the rms
 deviation divided by the number of spatial equivalent residues
 obtained after superposition of p<sub>i</sub> and p<sub>j</sub>
 using SOFIST [3] program. The distance matrix was generated by
 applying <i>d</i> to all pair of proteins. The clustering procedure
 was done by using the neighbor joining method as implemented in the
 PHYLIP [2] package.</p>
 <p><b>3 Results and Conclusions</b></p>
 <p>To illustrate our method we applied the two clustering
 procedures described above to a set of 16 protein structures
 adopting 2 different folds. Eight of these adopt the OB fold (PDB
 codes: 1csp, 1bovA, 1lttD, 1cuk, 1j5E, 1asyA, 1a0i and 1ey0A) and a
 further 8 adopt the SH3 fold (PDB codes: 1shg, 1ihvA, 1d0zA, 1bia,
 1vie, 1dj7B, 1psf, 1whi). These folds have the same architecture
 but differ in their topology.&nbsp; As can be observed in Figure
 1A, our procedure achieves a perfect grouping of the proteins
 belonging to each fold. On the other hand the more traditional
 method (Figure 1B), which uses the matrix of pairwise structural
 alignments is unable to classify correctly 1ey0A and 1d0zA. In
 particular, the first structure, reported as a SH3 fold, is found
 to be the closest structure to 1shg, reported as OB fold.</p>
 <p><img width="312" height="163" src="image005.gif">This
 preliminary result indicates that the information on multiple
 alignments can be more informative than that obtained from pair
 wise alignments. This approach should therefore, be useful in
 clustering and classification of proteins structures, especially
 for difficult cases, were very similar pairwise structural
 similarity scores are obtained for different pairs of
 structures.</p>

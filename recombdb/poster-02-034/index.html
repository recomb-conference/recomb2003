 <p><b>Keywords:</b> gene mining, remote protein homology, four
 helical cytokine</p>
 <p><b>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Introduction</b></p>
 <p>Remote homology detection (threading) using GeneFold [1] has
 been used to mine the human genome [2, 3] for novel proteins that
 are potential members of families of interest. Many protein
 sequences are of unknown function, and many of these are not easily
 classified by sequence comparison methods. We describe here a
 method for identifying proteins belonging to specific families,
 give an example of a group of proteins discovered using this
 method, and discuss their experimental validation.</p>
 <p><b>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Mining Method</b></p>
 <p>Representative sequences from several known protein families
 were first run through GeneFold in order to obtain a list of hits
 characteristic for each family. This allowed for a clustering of
 the GeneFold hits from sequences of unknown function into possible
 known protein families. While threading produces a large number of
 false positives, analysis of the data was facilitated by linking
 each hit to its cluster in an internal database of known proteins
 (GeneBase). Thus, sequences that hit a structure template which is
 itself hit by the family of interest are displayed together, sorted
 by their GeneFold score and annotated as to their family
 classification, if known.</p>
 <p><b>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> <b>Results</b></p>
 <p>Several possible four helical cytokines were identified using
 this method. One of these, which we will refer to here as IL-29
 (IMX129840-1), when used as the basis for BLAST detected additional
 related potential exons tightly linked in the genome to IL-29.
 Electronic assembly predicted two additional full length molecules
 in both human and mouse (IL-28A (IMX129840-3) and IL-28B
 (IMX129840-2)) highly related to IL-29, as well as potential exons
 in the human genome downstream of IL-28A that could encode for a
 different C-terminal portion of an IL-28 molecule (IMX129840-4).
 GeneFold analysis suggested that the two additional full length
 molecules also were potential 4 helical bundle cytokines. The exon
 structure of the predicted molecules was confirmed by RT-PCR and
 the 5&rsquo; and 3&rsquo; determined by RACE PCR. Expression of the
 molecules by cloning and transfection was used to verify they are
 truly secreted proteins. Real Time PCR was used to determine
 expression of the molecule in tissues and cell types. We also will
 present preliminary results examining IL-28 activity.</p>

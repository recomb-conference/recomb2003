 <h2>104. Computational Mutagenesis Using an Empirical Four-Body
 Potential</h2>

 tessellation</p>
 <p>Nonlocal interactions between the amino acid residues play
 important role in the specificity and stability of protein
 structures. Methods of computational geometry, including Delaunay
 tessellation, provide a robust and effective approach for
 quantitative description of nonlocal residue contacts in proteins
 [1,2]. An empirical four-body potential derived using Delaunay
 tessellation of structures from a representative protein data set
 helps facilitate understanding and interpretation of
 structure-sequence and structure-function correlations in
 proteins.</p>

      Figure 1: 3D-1D profiles for a wild type HIV reverse transcriptase (1rtj) and three mutants.&#13;
      ">A training set of 1,000 non-homologous high quality X-ray
      structures of protein chains without gaps in sequence was
      selected from PDB. These proteins were tessellated using
      single point per residue (Ca) representation. Distribution of
      log-likelihood values for all residue combinations in the
      Delaunay quadruplets was used as a four-body statistical
      potential. This knowledge-based potential has been used to
      study the effects of mutation on protein activity and
      stability. Each residue in a protein participates in a number
      of Delaunay quadruplets. Total score for a residue is
      calculated as a sum of log-likelihood scores of all Delaunay
      quadruplets in which this residue participates. This score for
      all residues along the sequence is shown in the upper plot in
      Fig. 1. To evaluate the effect of mutation we simply change
      the identity of one or more residues in the protein and
      recalculate the score. Then we subtract the mutant profile
      from that of wild type protein and get a difference profile
      shown in the lower plots of Fig. 1 for D185E, D185V, and D185Y
      mutants of HIV reverse transcriptase. The difference profiles
      reflect the magnitude of change that is caused by residue
      replacement and identify all residues affected by such a
      change.</p>

 Figure 2: Correlation between computed score and experimental activity for 1rtj.&#13;
      ">Correlation between the changes in calculated protein scores
      caused by mutations, experimental activity and thermodynamic
      data, is shown in Fig. 2. Here the average change in potential
      for all replacements in a set of almost 400 mutants of HIV
      reverse transcriptase [3] is correlated with the
      experimentally determined activity of mutants. For mutants
      with the higher than a wild type activity the average change
      in potential is positive, for less active mutants the negative
      change in potential is proportional to the decrease in
      activity. A strong correlation suggests significant predictive
      power of the computational mutagenesis method.</p>

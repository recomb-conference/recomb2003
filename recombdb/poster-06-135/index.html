 <h1><a name="SECTION00010000000000000000"><font size=
 "+1">Introduction</font></a></h1>
  <font size="-1">Although mechanically spotted DNA microarrays have
 become widely used for gene expression analysis, there have been
 relatively few studies aimed at optimizing the various steps in a
 microarray experiment, even though it is known that the overall
 process suffers from high variability. Observed problems with
 reliability and reproducibility can be overcome by a combination of
 sophisticated data analysis and advances in experimental methods.
 While the exploitation of multiple measurements plays a pivotal
 role in many state-of-the-art approaches to analysis, an efficient
 solution will benefit from an improved reliability of the
 individual measurements.</font> 
 <p><font size="-1">The quantification of a particular spot image
 always makes approximating assumptions about the spot morphology,
 i.e., the spot shape and internal structure. Typically, the
 intensities of all the pixels constituting a given spot are
 averaged to give a <i>signal</i> value assigned to the spot.
 Further data processing aims to correct for factors specific to
 individual slides or slide areas, like labelling and hybridization
 efficiencies or non-specific hybridization, ideally making the
 signal a good measure of sample RNA content matching the respective
 probe. In all cases, some kind of a spot model is assumed, and the
 pixel intensities are used as noisy measurements to infer the
 <i>signal</i> intensity of a given spot.</font></p>
 <p><font size="-1">In general, an ideal spot is modelled as a flat
 disc (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig:flatDiscProfile">1</a>), and the
 height of the disc is taken to represent the strength of the
 signal. Statistical models of experimentally observed spot images
 can be built [<a href="#BDCBT:02">1</a>], which
 show both the systematic and the random deviations of the true spot
 shape from that of a flat disc. Experimentally observed spots do
 not, unfortunately, resemble flat discs, and their morphology is
 determined by a multitude of interacting parameters (materials,
 printing and hybridization conditions employed, <img width="23"
 height="13" align="bottom" border="0" src="img1.png" alt=
 "$\dots$">). In the past, an exploration of these parameters has
 been difficult, relying largly on subjective comparisons by
 eye.</font></p>
 <p><font size="-1">Here, a quantitative method to assess spot
 morphology and its fluctuations by radial spot pixel intensity
 profiles is introduced and validated in the evaluation of over
 <img width="47" height="29" align="middle" border="0" src=
 "img2.png" alt="$24\times6$"> spotting buffer / slide chemistry
 combinations. With current spot quantification methods in mind, a
 spot shape resembling the idealized flat disc is considered
 advantageous. More importantly, minimal fluctuations in spot shape
 make single spot measurements more robust, a benefit that will
 apply equally well for more elaborate spot models of the future. We
 present buffer / slide combinations that satisfy these criteria and
 also score well regarding other experimental
 requirements.</font></p>
 <h1><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000"><font size=
 "+1">Results</font></a></h1>
  <font size="-1">Spot morphology and its variance were assessed
 objectively by measuring the average and variance of radial spot
 pixel intensity profiles. The variances assessed comprised
 deviations from radial symmetry and spot-to-spot reproducibility,
 as well as general pin-to-pin differences and slide effects. A
 quantitative and systematic evaluation of over <img width="47"
 height="29" align="middle" border="0" src="img2.png" alt=
 "$24\times6$"> buffer / slide combinations yielded a new protocol
 giving superior spot profiles with minimal variance whilst also
 scoring excellently on other technical considerations. The process
 introduced here can generally be applied to evaluate new materials
 and technologies as they emerge.</font>

 [1]&nbsp;A&nbsp;schematic representation of the traditional ideal
 spot shape. The horizontal axis shows distance from the spot
 centre, the vertical axis plots intensity. The radial spot profile
 is straight and shown by the dashed line. The mean pixel intensity
 used as the signal value is seen in the height of the dashed
 line.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2]&nbsp;Construction of the average
 and variance of a radial spot profile from a subgrid of spots. The
 vertical scale measures intensities of individual spot pixels
 <i>vs</i> their radial distances on the horizontal axis. The dashed
 line is the average signal value of all spots in the subgrid. The
 mean spot pixel intensity has been used as the signal value for
 each individual spot (see&nbsp;[1]). The solid line traces the
 subgrid Loess average. For demonstration purposes, the pixels of
 only two randomly chosen spots are shown. For comparison purposes,
 the scales give values normalized per
 subgrid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[3]&nbsp;Average and variance of a
 radial spot profile from a subgrid of spots. The results for the
 entire subgrid are shown, both the average profile shape and the
 Loess smoothed local variance. Note the higher variance at the spot
 edge, which can already be seen in the bigger spread of the raw
 pixel data in&nbsp;[2].</caption>

 <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
 <p>In the given work we present the application of the Lorenz
 curves to study the distribution of triplets in coding sequences of
 genes. These curves allows us to see the distribution of the
 triplets in gene coding sequences for different species taking into
 account the idea of the Lorenz curves and index numbers.
 Calculation of the index numbers allows us to look at the problem
 of evolution for different species. The Lorenz curves are well
 known to be characteristics of various distributions at the
 analysis of economic and financial processes. In particular they
 are used at the description of price information for goods, an
 amount of the goods and for the description of production function
 at elasticity constant of substitution [1]. The aim of this work is
 to present the application of the Lorenz curve for the description
 of the distribution of the triplets in a coding regions of DNA
 sequences. We are going also to calculate the index numbers as
 characteristic of the Lorenz curve and evolution of species because
 we expect that the index numbers are changed during the evolution
 for different species. The second aim of this work is to compare
 the index numbers for genes of different species and to determine
 the changes of these index numbers in time.</p>
 <h4>Results and Discussion</h4>
 <p>To use the method of the Lorenz curve application for the
 description of the distribution of the triplet frequencies in gene
 coding sequences we consider variables y(x) and x on a segment from
 0 up to 1. Taking into account the number of all possible triplets
 we divide the segment [0,1] in x on 64 parts. Obviously, this
 amount of parts corresponds to number of all triplets for alphabet
 with four letters. Further as the first step we calculate the total
 amount of different triplets in the coding sequence. After this the
 frequencies of all triplets is calculated for a coding sequence.
 With this purpose each term of a sequence f<sub>i</sub> is
 normalized on the total number of triplets in a coding sequence.
 The second step consists in procedures of creation of an increasing
 sequence on frequency repetition of triplets in a coding sequence.
 Let us assume this growing sequence of triplet frequencies takes
 the form: f<sub>i</sub>, i=1,...,64. Let these frequencies look
 like
 {w<sub>1</sub>,w<sub>2</sub>,w<sub>3</sub>,...,w<sub>64</sub>},
 i=1,...,64. Using this sequence it is possible to construct
 coordinates, y<sub>n</sub>, (n=1,...,64) taking into account the
 following expressions:<sub><img width="56" height="33" src=
 "image002.gif"></sub>; n=1,...,64, y<sub>0</sub>=0;
 y<sub>65</sub>=1. Values determined by the last formula together
 with coordinates x<sub>n</sub> correspond to the Lorenz curve for
 the description of the triplet distribution in gene coding
 sequences.</p>
 <p>It follows by the represented above formulas, that in case of
 uniformly distributed for the frequency repetition of triplets in a
 coding sequence (in this case all f<sub>i</sub> are equal), the
 Lorenz curve is a linear function. If we have the only one triplet
 in a coding sequence the Lorenz curve is the brightly expressed
 peak near to a point x=1. This case corresponds to the full
 heterogeneity for the frequency repetition of a triplet in a gene
 coding sequence.</p>
 <p>It is very important to evaluate a deviation degree of the
 Lorenz curve from uniformly distributed of triplets in a gene
 coding sequences. With this purpose the index number are used in
 financial mathematics these ones are called the index factors. This
 factor is introduced as the value that is equal to a double
 difference between 0.5 and the square under the Lorenz curve and
 axe of abscissas. Therefore the index factor is the characteristic
 of a deviation in distribution of triplet frequency repetition in a
 coding sequence from the uniformly distributed of the triplet
 distribution. It varies in limits from 0 up to 1 and corresponds to
 zero value in the case of the uniformly distributed of the triplet
 distribution and 1 in case only one triplet in a coding
 sequence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Taking into account the Lorenz curve one can find the analog of
 the statistical distribution function on frequency repetition of
 triplet [2]. For this work the DNA sequences from Genbank
 (Los-Alamos, USA) were used. We selected first, as the starting
 point, DNA sequences for coding regions. With this aim the computer
 program was written to look for corresponding sequences for globin
 and histon genes. After the first step the frequency repetitions
 were calculated and the Lorenz curves were determined. Taking into
 account the Lorenz curve the index numbers for corresponding genes
 were calculated.</p>
 <p>We made the attempt to compare index numbers for different genes
 and we undertaken the attempt to look for a criterion of organism
 evolution. With this purpose the index factors were calculated for
 the same genes for different organisms. We used the following genes
 to analyze the triplets: serine/threonine kinase, reverse
 transcriptase, pyruvate kinase, heat shock protein 70, glucose
 &ndash; 6 &ndash; phosphate dehydrogenase, gag protein and
 cytochrone P450. Genes were selected from bacteria, invertebrates,
 mammals, plants, primates, rodents and vertebrates. We calculated
 for all genes the index factors.</p>
 <p>We have observed that the index factors have values from 0.4 to
 0.8. For an example for pyruvate kinase gene the index factor for
 Eimeria tenella is 0.446, but for the Oryctolagus cuniculus the
 index factor is 0.535. We have obtained some evolution picture of
 the frequency repetitions of the triplets. We have found weights of
 triplets for different species. Fractal properties were considered
 to analyze the index factors. We have got there is persistent
 properties of the triplet distribution of different species.</p>

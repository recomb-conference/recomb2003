 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolutionary
 algorithms are ubiquitous nowadays, having been successfully
 applied to numerous problems from different domains. All various
 types of genetic&nbsp; algorithms have at least some of the formal
 structure of genetic systems and the approach to the best solution
 in the applications is analogous to the natural selection of the
 fittest. There have been an enormous number of evolutionary
 processes used in these algorithms, all of which are more or less
 theoretically described.</p>
 <p>However, in many cases the applicability of such approaches is
 not possible, due to the blurred view of the underlying procedures.
 One of these procedures has to do with the group selection issue.
 We had been faced with this difficulty in the attempt to determine
 the set of the most parsimonious solutions in molecular
 phylogenetics.</p>
 <p>It is not known how natural selection solves similar problems
 and no theoretical descriptions exist. So, we have been using
 various relevant fitness functions in order to extend the fitness
 of the individual solution to the group of related ones.</p>
 <p>Furthermore it is necessary the individuals to be endowed with
 appropriate behaviour within and between groups, for simulating
 their &ldquo;strangle for survival&rdquo; by evolutionary
 algorithms. In computer simulation experiments some behavioural
 strategies have emerged with very interesting characteri&shy;stics.
 Conditions are analyzed under which natural selection favours the
 evolution of these strategies.</p></div>

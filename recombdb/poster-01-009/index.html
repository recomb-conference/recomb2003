 <h2>9.&nbsp; Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms: novel methods to
 predict their functional effects using Decision Trees and Support
 Vector Machines</h2>

 <p><b>Keywords:</b> Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, Machine
 learning, prediction and mutations.</p>
 <p>A common type of slight discrepancies that are prevalent in DNA
 sequences from the same species, involving deletions, insertions
 and substitutions are known as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
 (SNPs). Although SNPs can be classified as synonymous and
 non-synonymous based on whether they alter the encoded protein
 sequence or not, the non-synonymous type are the most important as
 they can alter the protein function. These SNPs play a key role in
 understanding variations in drug treatment responses to individuals
 at the molecular level and designing therapy. To understand the
 genetic and phenotypic variation, it is important to understand the
 effect of non-synonymous SNPs on protein structure and
 function.</p>
 <p>Here, we present our work which is to focus on establishing a
 method to predict whether a given SNP affects the protein function
 or not, by Machine Learning (ML) tools. Various Machine Learning
 tools have advantages and disadvantages of their own. Therefore, in
 order to achieve a robust method a comparative study has been done
 here using Decision Trees (C4.5 [1]) and Support Vector Machines
 (SVM [2]). Prediction results from both the tools are presented
 here.</p>
 <p>The methods are trained on extensive unbiased mutagenesis data
 from Lysozyme and Lac repressor proteins. Various cross-validation
 strategies on the data sets have been performed to check the
 prediction accuracy and compared with other available methods. The
 trained machine learning tools are then applied to make the
 predictions on the SNP data between the N2 strain and Hawaiian
 strain (CB4856 sequence) of the nematode worm <i>Caenorhabditis
 elegans</i>. Together with providing predictions for functional
 effects of <i>C. elegans</i> SNPs we provide a detailed comparative
 study of the utility and prediction accuracy of the two ML
 methods.</p>
